{"name":"William A Stevens","tagline":"Me, My Projects, My Life","body":"### A Brief Introduction\r\nMy full name is William A Stevens V (although most people call me Billy). I am a Junior in Information Technology at a technical high school. As a part of my class I have learned skills for CompTIA A+ computer repair, Cisco networking, and web design.\r\n\r\nHowever, my personal interests have taken me much further into the Computing and Electronics field. I’ve explored projects in areas such as computer programming, Linux server management, computer security, microcontrollers, and Ham Radio. This site will be a place for me to record and publish my projects in these areas.\r\n\r\nMy interest in programming started at 12 years old with a game I wrote in [DarkBASIC](http://www.thegamecreators.com/?m=view_product&id=2030). Since then my programming skills have evolved. Currently, I primarily focus on Java, Node.js, VB, and Python. However, I've also experimented with C (including AVR/Arduino), C++, BASIC, Lua, and just about any language I can get. I'm constantly looking for new ways to expand my knowledge and experience in computer science and computer engineering.\r\n\r\n### My Current Projects\r\n* [ScoutNet](http://projects.wastevensv.com/ScoutNet/) - A FRC Scouting system written in Node.js and jQuery.\r\n* [ShapeClicker](https://github.com/wastevensv/ShapeTesting) - A simple visual implementation of nodes and connectors. Mostly for experimental purposes.\r\n* [MDEdit](http://projects.wastevensv.com/MDEdit/) - A minimalist web based markdown editor. I plan to use it to keep a personal journal. But I'm sure it has other uses.\r\n\r\n### Past Projects\r\n* [ScoutKit](http://projects.wastevensv.com/ScoutKit/) - FRC Scouting database management software written in Java.\r\n* [AIML-Designer](https://github.com/wastevensv/AIML-Designer) - A Visual Basic program to simplify the process of creating files for chatbots.\r\n* Also see my [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/wastevensv) for more of my work.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
