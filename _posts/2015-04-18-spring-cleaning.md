Today 3 more truckloads of stuff left my basement. One was mostly cardboard and went to the dump. I didn't have much attachment to any of that.

The next two loads went to a local electronics recycling center. The first of those loads was a bunch of monitors and miscellaneous junk. The next load was the hard part, removing two gigantic tube TVs. One of which had a wooden frame and was roughly the size of a washing machine. Reflecting on it now, I realize there wasn't much I really needed from those two loads either.

Between now and last month I got rid of a bunch of stuff that I didn't need without creating much waste. That's a lot better than throwing it all in a landfill or leaving it on the side of the road to rot. It also feels good to have the basement empty(ish) for once.

The PC shelf is now down to 2 PCs and a small TV.

I also took the time to organize what's left of my LEGO collection. I plan to bring the clear blue tote to college.
