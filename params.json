{"name":"William A Stevens","tagline":"Me, My Projects, My Life","body":"### A Brief Introduction\r\nMy full name is William A Stevens V (although most people call me Billy). I am a Junior in Information Technology at a technical high school. As a part of my class I have learned skills for CompTIA A+ computer repair, Cisco networking, and web design.\r\n\r\nHowever, my personal interests have taken me much further into the Computing and Electronics field. Iâ€™ve explored projects in areas such as computer programming, Linux server management, computer security, microcontrollers, and Ham Radio. This site will be a place for me to record and publish my projects in these areas.\r\n\r\nMy interest in programming started at 12 years old with a game I wrote in [DarkBASIC](http://www.thegamecreators.com/?m=view_product&id=2030). Since then my programming skills have evolved. Currently, I primarily focus on Java, Node.js, VB, and Python. However, I've also experimented with C (including AVR/Arduino), C++, BASIC, Lua, and just about any language I can get. I'm constantly looking for new ways to expand my knowledge and experience in computer science and computer engineering.\r\n\r\n### My Current Projects\r\n* [ScoutNet](http://projects.wastevensv.com/ScoutNet/) - A FRC Scouting system written in Node.js and jQuery.\r\n* [ShapeClicker](https://github.com/wastevensv/ShapeTesting) - A simple visual implementation of nodes and connectors. Mostly for experimental purposes.\r\n* [MDEdit](http://projects.wastevensv.com/MDEdit/) - A minimalist web based markdown editor. I plan to use it to keep a personal journal. But I'm sure it has other uses.\r\n\r\n### Past Projects\r\n* [ScoutNet](http://projects.wastevensv.com/ScoutKit/) - FRC Scouting database management software written in Java.\r\n* [AIML-Designer](https://github.com/wastevensv/AIML-Designer) - A Visual Basic program to simplify the process of creating files for chatbots.\r\n* Also see my [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/wastevensv) for more of my work.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
