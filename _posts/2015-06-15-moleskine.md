summary: How I organize my Moleskine Notebook.
---
My system for my moleskine is very minimal. Just write as needed in chronological order. The important part is the reference section in the back so that I can quickly find the things that I wrote.

The page number is incremented for each pair of pages and uses A and B for the left and right sides (for example, the numbers go 1.A, 1.B, 2.A, 2.B). Then each section on a page has a roman numeral so the sections above are 1.A.I, 1.A.II - 1.B.I.

I also made some tags for the top of my Moleskine to designate each section. Eventually I plan to mark the sides of the pages to designate what each one contains.
