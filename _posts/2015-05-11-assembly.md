summary: Converting from bits to a hexadecimal string using assembly language.
---

## What did I do?
I made a program in [assembly language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language) that converts a binary number stored in memory to a string of [hexadecimal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal) characters and prints them to the standard output. The code is primarily borrowed from a tutorial on operating system development, except that I converted it to work under Linux.

## Why did I do this?
I got bored and I wanted a challenge. (That could explain a lot of my projects.)

## Where is the code?
The code is in my assembly language GitHub repository with instructions on how to assemble, link, and run the program. This specific program is at [linux/03_hex/v01/hex.asm](https://github.com/wastevensv/Assembly/blob/3ada8a0c4d585db14f46e4d691ababaa8e999a9d/linux/03_hex/v01/hex.asm).

**UPDATE (2015-05-13):** I've made big improvments to the hex program in the past 2 days. I'm acutally starting to pick up some of the strategies of working with assembly (like designing on paper before typing code). I've added the ability to specify the number on the command line and expanded the word_to_hexstr function to allow for 32 bit integers. The new version is at [linux/03_hex/v02/hex.asm](https://github.com/wastevensv/Assembly/blob/1a315426cc4d27d35f95d91b13d35031a4b471ba/linux/03_hex/v02/hex.asm).
