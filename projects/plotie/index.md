I recently made a quick web app called [Plotie](http://www.wastevensv.com/Plotie/) for a friend of mine who is a writer. It creates a random character and plot to inspire creative writing. It's very simple code, but it was fun to make.

I write code though, not books. So if you have any ideas for plots, please send them to [plotie@wastevensv.com](mailto:plotlie@wastevensv.com) and I'll add them. As always, the code is open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/wastevensv/Plotie/).
