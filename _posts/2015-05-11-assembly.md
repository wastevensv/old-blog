summary: Converting from bits to a hexadecimal string using assembly language.
---

## What did I do?
I made a program in [assembly language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language) that converts a binary number stored in memory to a string of [hexadecimal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal) characters and prints them to the standard output. The code is primarily borrowed from a tutorial on operating system development, except that I converted it to work under Linux.

## Why did I do this?
I got bored and I wanted a challenge. (That could explain a lot of my projects.)

## Where is the code?
The code is in my assembly language GitHub repository with instructions on how to assemble, link, and run the program. This specific program is under at [linux/03_hex/hex.asm](https://github.com/wastevensv/Assembly/blob/master/linux/03_hex/hex.asm).
