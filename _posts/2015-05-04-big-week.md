This post is really a collection of things that happened in the last week. Each of them could be more or less a post.

## CCENT Certification
As of Thursday morning (2015-04-30) I am now officially CCENT certified. I passed with the equivalent of a 90 (an 80 was needed to pass).

## SkillsUSA State Championship

Later that Thursday and into Friday night, I attended the SkillsUSA State Championship. This is a competition for students in Vocational-Technical High Schools to show off what they have learned in their shops. I competed in computer programming. Programming has only recently been introduced officially into my shop, but I've been coding and building for fun long before that. Most of my practice has been done in my free time at home, in shop, or as a part of the FRC Robotics team.

In addition to being a competition, it is also a great learning experience. The language for the competition is Visual Basic and is taught by a Microsoft MVP. The challenge consisted of designing and developing an application from start to finish in 5 hours. Last year the task was to design and create a checkbook application.

This year it was to make a scoreboard for scoring [Cricket](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_(darts)) (the dart game, not the bat-and-ball game). I had started with a user control module for scoring 2 players on one section of the dart board. Then I used that module 5 more times to score the whole board. I also added some graphics drawn up quickly in paint.

Towards the end of the competition, I reread the portion of the Wikipedia article given to us in the instructions. It said cricket could be played by 2, **3, or 4** people. I was worried I'd be the only one to limit my game to 2 players. I quickly rewrote most of the program in 1 hour to accommodate 4 players. After the contest was over, we were all talking about our programs, and it turns out I was the only one to write it for 4 people. Going that extra mile earned me the Gold Medal in Computer programming. I'll be headed to Louisville later this year for SkillsUSA Nationals.

I might upload the code after nationals. If anyone is interested, please [contact me](mailto:contact@wastevensv.com)

## ImagineRIT
In addition to all this, I spent the weekend at Rochester Institute of Technology to visit my future college during the ImagineRIT festival. There were so many interesting projects and people there. I can't wait to go there for real this fall.
