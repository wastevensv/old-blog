<p class="entry">For the final project of my CompTIA A+ certification course, I was given the opportunity to design, order, and build my own PC to be used for the remainder of my high school career. The entire shop divided into groups to compete for the best design. We had to create a professional presentation to persuade the class to vote for our design. This was designed to accurately simulated the process of bidding on a project for a client.</p>
