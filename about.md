# What is this site?
This is the personal blog of William A Stevens V (although most people call me Billy or Will. Not Bill.). The V stands for 'the fifth'. There are **a lot** of Williams in my family.

# How did you make this site?
I used [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) as a blogging platform and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host this blog. However, my [main site](http://www.wastevensv.com/) is hosted on [NearlyFreeSpeech.net](https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/). NearlyFreeSpeech is an amazing, inexpensive hosting provider if you don't mind a bit of DIY work.

# Why did you make this site?
Good question. Quite simply this site to keep a record of my projects and ideas. Primarily this site is designed for myself. I made it public so that others may benefit from my work.

# What will you be posting?
Another good question. I'm not even sure what yet. Mostly project logs, project ideas, and things I find interesting.
