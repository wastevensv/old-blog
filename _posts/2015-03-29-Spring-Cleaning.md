Today I took the time to empty out my basement of all the old stuff I no longer need. The idea of throwing out stuff that someone could still use always bothered me, so I gave a good portion of the useful stuff to a friend who I knew would use it. This helped to make sure that what was left could be thrown out without anyone missing it. This included a partially disassembled VCR, some half used cables, and a box of stuff I got off the side of the road and never used.

I didnt throw out everything of course. I still have a lot more piles to work through. But I've made pretty good progress on cleaning out for college.

At one point I had around 15 computer cases. Now I'm down to 5 (and one more that I'm using). Three of these cases will be on the way out in the next week.
